# Survey original setup instructions

I am using Cloudflare for this since that is just where I am doing things. If something else is used, this process won't work. I am mostly writing this when I forget what I did, or need to set it up later on if I have to change platforms.

1. Create a new database on your Cloudflare account. I made one called "m2m-survey-responses".
2. Get the UUID of the database using the npx command in command prompt: npx wrangler d1 list
3. Run this command to create the table that stores responses: 

    npx wrangler d1 execute m2m-survey-responses --remote --file=static/survey/schema.sql

4. Run this command to actually deploy the new "worker" that will process the survey being sent: 

    npx wrangler deploy

The schema file also creates the `animation_requests` table used by the "Request an animation" dialog (POST /animation-request). The statements use `IF NOT EXISTS`, so re-running step 3 on an existing database only adds missing tables.

## Viewing responses

`survey/index.html` shows the latest 50 feedback submissions and animation requests. It reads from the worker's `GET /responses` endpoint, which requires an admin token. Set the token as a worker secret (it is never stored in the repo), then enter it on the page:

    npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN

Without the secret set, the endpoint rejects every request.
