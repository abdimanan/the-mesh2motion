"""Keyframe cleanup: smoothing and decimation.

A retargeted Mocopi capture lands as one keyframe per bone per channel per
frame, carrying every bit of the capture's high-frequency jitter. Two passes
fix that, and they are deliberately separate operations:

**Smooth** blurs the *values* along time with a Gaussian, leaving the key
count alone. This is the pass that removes shake. It runs in frame space, so
the width is stated in frames rather than as an opaque 0..1 factor -- at 24fps
a sigma of 1 is about a twelfth of a second, which kills sensor noise without
softening a footplant.

**Decimate** removes *keys* that the curve does not need, using
Ramer-Douglas-Peucker with a vertical error bound: a key survives only if
dropping it would move the curve further than the tolerance at some frame.
Tolerances are given in real units -- metres for position, degrees for
rotation -- so half a degree means no bone ever ends up more than half a
degree from where it was. That holds only because the surviving keys get
tangents aimed along clamped neighbour chords; see ``chord_handles`` for
what auto-clamped handles did to this guarantee, and for the stepped-signal
ringing that a raw chord tangent traded it for.

How much that removes depends entirely on how fast the bone is moving, which
is the point. Measured on synthetic 300-frame channels at 0.5 degrees: a
near-still bone keeps 2% of its keys, a drifting head 4%, a swaying spine
11%, a thigh swinging through a five-step walk 34%. The busy channels are the
ones that earn their keys.

**Simplify Pole Targets** is the same two passes at a much looser setting,
aimed at the four IK pole bones and nothing else. A pole target is a hint,
not animation: Blender's IK constraint reads its *position* and the pole
angle, and nothing at all reads its rotation. So the rotation channels
collapse to a single key, and the position channels are blurred and decimated
several times harder than a real bone would tolerate. On a dense capture this
is most of the keys on the rig.

**Delete Non-Extreme Keyframes** is the odd one out: it is not error-bounded
and it is not automatic. Blender tags every key with a *type* -- Keyframe,
Breakdown, Moving Hold, Extreme, Jitter -- which the evaluator ignores but
which is how an animator records that a pose is load-bearing. Mark the
extremes by hand, run the pass, and every channel is thinned down to exactly
those frames. It is the only pass here making a judgement about the
performance rather than about the numbers, which is why it is a button and
never an import option: at import time there is nothing marked yet.

Order matters. Smooth first: smoothing works on key values, so it wants the
dense curve. Then root motion, then the pole pass, then decimate last -- root
motion writes a key on every frame of every control by design, including the
poles, so anything that thins them has to come after it. The extreme pass sits
outside that order entirely; it runs whenever the marks are ready.

Both passes ignore the Mesh2Motion export skeleton, which holds no keyframes
at all -- its bones are driven by Copy Transforms constraints off the DRV rig.
Everything here operates on whatever action the active armature is holding.

    This is what keeps the decimation tolerance honest. Two failure modes had
    to be dodged, and they pull in opposite directions.

    **Auto-clamped flattens the ends.** ``AUTO_CLAMPED`` zeroes the handles of
    any key that is a local extreme among its neighbours, and a key with only
    one neighbour -- either end of the curve -- always qualifies. A channel
    that decimates to two keys therefore gets two flat handles and the segment
    comes out as a full ease-in/ease-out S-curve, not the straight line the RDP
    pass measured its error against. On a straight 0 -> 2.4m ramp over 120
    frames at a 1mm tolerance that was 229mm off at the quarter points -- 229x
    what was asked for. Plain ``AUTO`` behaves identically. It is worst where
    decimation does best, since the channels that collapse to two or three
    keys are the near-still and slow-drifting ones.

    **A raw chord tangent overshoots corners.** Taking the tangent straight
    from the chord through both neighbours (Catmull-Rom's) fixes the ramp
    exactly, but it rings on a stepped signal: 27mm on a 200mm staircase at
    the same 1mm tolerance, because the tangent at a plateau key points along
    the step it is about to take.

    So the tangent is the chord, clamped the way a monotone cubic clamps it
    (Fritsch-Carlson): zero at a local extreme, and never steeper than three
    times the shallower of the two adjacent secants. On a straight line the
    secants are equal and the clamp does not bind, so the result is exact. On
    a plateau the secants disagree and the tangent goes flat, which is the one
    thing ``AUTO_CLAMPED`` got right. The ends take their one-sided secant
    rather than zero, which is the thing it got wrong.

    Handles must be FREE for Blender to leave them alone; ``fcurve.update()``
    recomputes the AUTO family but not this one.

    For the two error-bounded passes this is a correctness fix. For
    ``delete_non_extreme`` it is a look choice instead -- there is no bound to
    hold between two poses an animator marked, and flat handles would give the
    held-extreme feel of traditional blocking. It shares the code path for
    consistency; splitting it is a one-line change if that look is wanted.

    a mark on the hips keeps frame 24 on the elbows too.

    Frames are rounded to integers. A bake lands on whole frames, and matching
    one float frame against another is a way to lose a key to 1e-7.

    Types are read one key at a time rather than through ``foreach_get``. The

    buffer is version-dependent -- and getting it wrong here would not be

    decimated away from the extreme frames would either lose everything or
    have to be skipped, and the rig would come out on ragged frame sets.

    Sampling is done up front, because ``evaluate`` has to read the curve as
    it stands -- before anything has been inserted into it or removed from it.

    Keyframe *types* are left alone. A key the sampling step inserts arrives
    as a plain Keyframe rather than an Extreme, which keeps the pass from
