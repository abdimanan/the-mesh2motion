## WHAT IS THIS SCRIPT FOR?
# Each BLEND file only has one animation action. This script consolidates all these actions and
# creates one GLB file that the Mesh2Motion tool can load.
# This will make loading faster since it will be one HTTP request
# if there gets to be a ton of animations, we can revisit this to split things apart.

## INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN
# 1. Open the rig-bird.blend file in Blender. This process should work for all the rig files
# 2. Open a "Text Editor" view and click New to create a new text area
# 3. Copy and paste this script into the text area
# 4. Update the path below to point to the rig you want to create a GLB for
# 5. Click the "Run Script" (play) button
# 6. You can put the GLB file in the static > animations folder overwriting the old rig one


current_file_path = bpy.data.filepath  # e.g., "C:\git\mesh2motion-assets\rigs\rig-kaiju.blend"
base_dir = os.path.dirname(current_file_path)  # e.g., "C:\git\mesh2motion-assets\rigs"
blend_filename = os.path.basename(current_file_path)  # e.g., "rig-kaiju.blend"
rig_type = blend_filename.replace("rig-", "").replace(".blend", "")  # e.g., "kaiju"



# DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE BELOW THIS LINE
#----------------------------------------------------

# Define the output file path. It will be saved in the same directory as the input files

# So we have to assign them to the armature object and then they will show up in the GLB export.
